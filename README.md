# SDDT

% ====================== SDDT_pred_muN_pD.m ========================
% This MATLAB code accompanies Ehlman et al. 2019 (Am Nat.) to generate Figures 2,3,
% and 4. Small alterations to this code (by altering sigmas) can be used to
% generate Figure 5. 

% State-dependent detection theory is used to calculate decision 
% thresholds before the introduction of exotic predators. These thresholds
% are then used post-introduction and fitness change is assessed.
