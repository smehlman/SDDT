Codebase for 'Prey responses to exotic predators: effects of old risks and new cues' (Ehlman et al. 2019, Am Nat), a state-dependent detection theoretic model.

This MATLAB code generates Figures 2, 3, and 4. Small alterations to this code (by altering sigmas) can be used to generate Figure 5. 

State-dependent detection theory is used to calculate decision thresholds before the introduction of exotic predators. These thresholds are then used post-introduction and fitness change is assessed.
